        "how_it_works": "1. All mobile specs (Brand, OS, Battery, etc.) were combined into a 'soup' of keywords. \n2. TF-IDF was used to find the most important keywords for each phone. \n3. A similarity matrix was built to store a score (0 to 1) of how similar each phone is to every other phone.",
        "what_it_is_used_for": "This model is perfect for 'cold-start' users or for a 'Find Similar Items' feature.",
        "example": "A user is viewing a 'Realme 7 Pro' (which has 'Android 10' and a 'battery_high'). This model can instantly find the top 10 other phones that *also* have 'Android 10' and a 'battery_high', even if they are from a different brand."
